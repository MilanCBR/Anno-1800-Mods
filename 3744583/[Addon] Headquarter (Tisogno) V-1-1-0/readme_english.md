# Headquarters (Tisogno)

This mod is an offer to enrich the endgame with new tasks and features and is primarily aimed at players of the type "collector".


## Preliminary Remarks

The creation of the mod was strongly inspired by the mod "The Administration" (previously: "The Academy") by Finnem, which is still available on Nexus, but has not been maintained for a year and a half and has no longer been functional since GU16 at the latest.
Despite the adaptation of some basic motifs such as
	- a headquarter complex as a kind of palace alternative (including keyword "Headquarter")
	- a palace building as a base object
	- a ministerial administration in the style of a cultural building with ministries as item sets and corresponding buffs
however, both mods differ significantly. "Headquarter" is an authentic standalone development and uses neither code nor graphics from "The Administration".

It should also be noted that the headquarters palace and ministry are externally identical to the original game palace and regional ministry, but are functionally completely independent.
The intention was to add a republican variant to the more royal vanilla complex.


## Requirements

- Availability of DLC 4 "Seat of Power"
To fully enjoy all the mod's features, it is recommended to use as many DLCs as possible.
Also additional building variations are sometimes only available if certain DLCs (or CDLCs) are active.


## Task

- Build a new government complex: the Headquarter.
- First build a Presidential Palace and use it to unlock additional objects.
- Then add a ministerial administration and fill a total of 18 ministries with the responsible specialists.
- Unlock a corresponding buff for each fully staffed Ministry.
- Build more buildings with special function bonuses.


## Installation

- Unzip the mod file (tisogno_headquarter.zip) and paste it into the Anno 1800 Mods folder.
   The result should look like this:
   	.../Anno 1800/Mods/[Addon] Headquarters (Tisogno)/data/...


## Menu connection and activation

- Unlock the Headquarter (HQ) menu and the Presidential Palace at 10,000 investors
- Unlock the additional elements once the Presidential Palace is built
- Old World construction menu: "Investors" tab and "Culture" tab, each after "Palace".


## Process (roughly sketched)

- For investors with 10,000 or more, the headquarter facilities in the Old World are available.
- First, a Presidential Palace must be built. This will unlock the remaining buildings.
- In the Presidential Palace resides (among others) the "President", an item that activates a special item pool for the visitor port of the island: the ministerial staff.
- The new specialists (84 in total) are moving into 18 ministries, which are administered in the main ministry building.
- There they group themselves (like animals in the zoo or similar) into item sets (10x6, 8x3), which trigger appropriate (game-wide!) buffs when completed.
- More buildings
	the Personnel Office,
	the Press Office,
	the Supreme Court,
	the Secret Service Center
	and the Consulates
  also grant specific buffs.


## Details

### Presidential Palace
- Activation from 10,000 investors
- One Presidential Palace per game is allowed and must be built in the Old World.
- User interface like a guildhouse, pre-populated with 3 items: "President", "Bodyguard", "Caretaker"
- The main palace building from the original game is used as graphics.
- Attractiveness bonus: 100 (+ 42% by the "President")
- Lock/unlock triggers for the remaining headquarters buildings and buffs:
	These will be unlocked once the Presidential Palace is built.
	Attention: If the Presidential Palace is demolished, all other HQ objects will also be automatically destroyed! The HQ items, apart from the 84 for the ministry buffs, will be lost either!
- If the DLC "Tourism" is activated, the Presidential Palace will be added to the list of tourist attractions and added to the bus network.

### Item "The President"
- Only available by building a Presidential Palace.
- Effect: Unlocks a special visitor pool for the palace island => 84 specialists to staff 18 ministries (see below) and increases the attractiveness of the palace.
	It is recommended not to use any other items/buffs (e.g. "Mme. Elise") that could potentially influence this visitor pool during the president's "term in office".

### Main Ministerial Building
- Available once the Presidential Palace is built (and only during its existence!)
- 1x per game (Old World only)
- User interface like a cultural building (zoo, museum, ..):
	 6 path ornaments (pavings, gates, benches, etc.)
	84 modules (= building wings)
	18 item sets (= ministries)
	18 specific buffs assigned to the sets
	1 music hall
- Graphically, the regional ministry from the original game is used for this building.

### Path Ornaments
- Limited to 500 pieces in total
- Graphically, 5 ornaments from the original game are used. The 6th element, a telephone booth, is only available if the CDLC "City Lights" is present.
- All modules, path ornaments as well as building wings, must be connected (at least indirectly) to the main building.

### Building Wings (modules)
- The palace modules from the original game are used as graphics. They can be varied via Skinlist (longitudinal structure, corner, T-piece, etc.).
	Additional variants are also available for the default selection (longitudinal building) via Shift-V before placing the building.
- The following special features apply:
	In contrast to the modules of other cultural buildings, the building wings can also be built on top of each other (theoretically 84x).
	This stacking enables immense space savings.
	Of course, only the top object of a stack is directly "tangible". Access to all underlying modules must be via the ministerial administration.
	Using this mechanic, the building wings can also be "buried" under any other graphic objects, but of course this doesn't make much sense.
	In general, only elements with the same skin should be stacked (for visual reasons).

### Item Sets
- 10 sets with 6 items each and 8 sets with 3 items
- All ministries employ a "Minister", a "Vice Minister" and a "State Secretary".
  The ministries with 6 posts also receive a "Chief Secretary", a "Trainee" and a "Lobbyist".
  All 84 items are only available as "specialists" via visitor ports, the pool of which has been changed either by the "President" or by "Consuls" (see below). So patience is required here.
  Except for the "trainees", all items provide additional influence (varying according to their "rank").
  All HQ items can only be socketed in HQ buildings, but are also visible in warehouses and can be loaded onto ships.
  Selling to dealers or taking them with you on expeditions doesn't make sense - what advantage do politicians bring?
- 18 ministries:
	 1. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (3 items)
	 2. Ministry of Military Affairs (6)
	 3. Ministry of the Interior (3)
	 4. Ministry of Trade (6)
	 5. Ministry of Finance (6)
	 6. Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (3)
	 7. Ministry of Industry (6)
	 8. Ministry of Entertainment (3)
	 9. Ministry of Energy (6)
	10. Ministry of Science and Education (3)
	11. Ministry of Agriculture (6)
	12. Ministry of Culture (3)
	13. Ministry of Health and Nutrition (6)
	14. Ministry of Transport (6)
	15. Ministry of Communication (3)
	16. Ministry of Construction and Housing (6)
	17. Ministry of Religion (3)
	18. Ministry of Tourism (6)

### Ministry Buffs
- All buffs work throughout the entire game, i.e. (unlike museum buffs) on all islands and in all sessions!
- The more DLCs are active, the greater the performance range of the buffs.
- All numerical effect units are divisors of the number 42 (7,14,21,42) - a reference to "42" as the ultimate answer to the question of the meaning of life.
- 18 Buffs:
	 1. Ministry of Foreign Affairs grants all offices takeover protection and an influence bonus
	 2. Ministry of Military Affairs boosts all military units
	 3. Ministry of Interior improves all city institutions (fire department, police, hospitals)
	 4. Ministry of Trade increases (especially) the loading speed of all kontors and piers
	 5. Ministry of Finance increases tax revenue
	 6. Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs pushes work efficiency and promotes resident satisfaction
	 7. Ministry of Industry stimulates the productivity of heavy industry (including mines, quarries, chemical factories).
	 8. Ministry of Entertainment makes entertainment establishments (theaters, clubs, pubs, cinema, podium, ..) even more entertaining
	 9. Ministry of Energy improves the performance balance of all power plants
	10. Ministry of Science and Education strengthens educational operations (range boost for schools and universities, an additional research point for residences of scholars)
	11. Ministry of Agriculture increases productivity of crop farms, animal farms and nurseries
	12. Ministry of Culture increases the attractiveness of all cultural buildings and the probability of finding rare cultural treasures by the salvage ship
	13. Ministry of Health and Nutrition reduces residents' demand for "unhealthy" food/drinks and grants additional residents for medicine
	14. Ministry of Transport boosts all merchant ships and zeppelins as well as all shipyards and hangars
	15. Ministry of Communication improves the productivity and storage capacity of all postal facilities as well as the range of radio towers
	16. Ministry of Construction and Housing promotes construction activity by increasing the productivity of all establishments in the construction industry
	17. Ministry of Religion makes residents happier through the presence of churches and reduces the demand for "sinful" products
	18. Ministry of Tourism attracts additional visitors

### Music Hall
- Analogous to the music pavilions of the cultural buildings
- Like them depending on the DLC 2 "Botanica"
- Initialized with the item "National Soundtrack",
	which only increases the attractiveness of the Presidential Palace, but does not grant bonuses for item sets,
	and which musically matches the soundtrack item "Anno 1800".
- The mini world exhibition hall is used graphically;
   	if DLC 1 ("Sunken Treasures") is available, the two buildings for the capon scepter are available as alternatives (via Shift-V before placing the building).

### Human Resources Office
- Available once the Presidential Palace is built (and only during its existence!)
- 1x per game (Old World)
- User interface like a guildhouse, preset with 1 item: "Personnel Director"
	This increases the likelihood of visitors to the respective island in order to recruit specialist staff.
- Graphically, a building from Archibald's Island from the original game's campaign is used by default.
  Alternatively (via Shift-V before placing the building)
	if DLC 9 ("High Life") is available, a sky tower,
	if DLC 11 ("Empire of the Skies") is available, the press tower from the scenario
  can be used.

### Press Office
- Available once the Presidential Palace is built (and only during its existence!)
- 1x per game (Old World)
- User interface like a guildhouse, preset with 1 item: "Press Spokesman"
	He ought to improve the mood of the people through successful media work and thus reduce the risk of uprisings (see Known Issues).
- Graphically, a museum hall from the original game is used by default.
  Alternatively (via Shift-V before placing the building)
	if DLC 6 (Land of Lions") is available, the radio tower,
	if DLC 2 ("Botanica") is available, a greenhouse
  can be used.

### Supreme Court
- Available once the Presidential Palace is built (and only during its existence!)
- 1x per game (Old World)
- User interface like a public service building
- Fulfills the need of all(!) residents for "Social Justice".
   	Needs are satisfied not through road connections, but through a game-wide buff.
   	The need is activated as soon as 10,000 investors and 100 of the respective population level have been reached.
- Graphically, the court from the campaign of the original game is used.

### Secret Service Centre
- Available once the Presidential Palace is built (and only during its existence!)
- Theoretically buildable as often as you like (in the Old World), but not recommended because of the immense maintenance costs
- Only to be built on clay pits(!)
- The AW warehouse (highest level) from the original game is used as graphics for the purpose of "camouflage"!
- User interface like a guildhouse, pre-filled with 3 items (= agents): "Mr. X-007", "Agent undercover", "Double Agent"
	The 3 agent items together form a special set with two session-related buff effects:
	- Preventing the takeover of island shares
	- Drastic increase in the maintenance costs of all HQ buildings
An attempt to sell the agents to traders could end in a boomerang.

### Consulates
- Available once the Presidential Palace is built (and only during its existence!)
- Buildable in the New World
	from 1,000 Obreras
	maximum 4
	menu connection under "Obreras" and "City" after the town hall
	graphic: a building from the Eden scenario
- Buildable in Enbesa, provided the mod "Enbesa Tourism" by Lion053 is included in the game
	from 1,000 Elders
	maximum 3
	menu connection under "Elders" and "City" after the town hall
	graphic: a building from the imperial treasure trove of Taborime
- User interface like a guildhouse, preset with 1 item: "Consul"
	This works on visitor piers and unlocks the same item pool as the "President".
	This is intended to make collecting ministerial items easier.
- Both consulate graphics do not have their own ground textures, which is why a mechanic has been implemented that allows them to be underlaid with any ground textures.
- Because the radius of influence of consulates overlaps with that of guildhouses, it is very limited. Therefore, the consulates should be built in close proximity to the visitor piers.


It should be noted again that any demolition of the Presidential Palace will trigger the immediate destruction of all other HQ buildings and lead to a loss of the building-associated HQ items (but not the 84 buff items)!


## Compatibility

- The mod proved to be compatible with existing save games in all tests.
- In addition to the obligatory DLC 4 "Palace of Power", there are minor partial dependencies on almost all other DLCs with regard to:
	- the availability of additional building variants
	- effects of buffs
- The mod was tested with around 100 other mods without any compatibility conflicts arising.
	In the future, particular attention should be paid to mods that influence visitor probabilities and/or pools.
	The HQ mod uses the unique and item allocation type "Headquarter" - if other mods also use this, incompatibilities would immediately arise.
	If the above-mentioned mod "The Administration" were ever to be updated, the compatibility of both mods could be achieved through minor adjustments.
	A sensible interaction occurs with the mod "Enbesa Tourism" from Lion053, the presence of which enables the construction of consulates in Enbesa.
- The mod has not been tested in multiplayer mode.


## Creative mode

- All elements of the mod are available from the start of the game.
- The only restriction, as in the normal endless game, is that a Presidential Palace must be built before all other objects are unlocked.
In addition, using it in creative mode doesn't seem to make much sense, as most of the buffs there are pointless.


## Language support

So far the mod only supports two languages: English and German.
Since my time resources are very limited and my own language skills are limited, I will not be able to deliver any further language versions in the near future.

But here I'll outline a way you can help yourself get to the language you want (assuming it's generally supported by the game, i.e. it has to be listed in the game options).
Please proceed as follows:
1. Navigate in the mod folder tree first to my mod and then to the directory with the text files. The path should look something like this: <Mod folder>/[Addon] Headquarters (Tisogno)/data/config/gui.
2. Make a copy of the file "texts_english.xml" and rename it for your target language - e.g. for a French version to "texts_french.xml" (the national language name must be in English).
3. Open the file with a text editor and run the entire content through a translation program (e.g. Google Translate); if necessary, it must be divided into several blocks.
4. Then replace the old content with the translation results.
5. [optional] Proofreading, especially to restore Anno-specific terms (e.g. "Docklands" or similar) if necessary.
But attention, be careful:
When translating and exchanging, it is important to ensure that the keyword tags within the angle brackets (e.g. "<ModOp>", "<GUID>", "<Text>", ..) are retained in their original spelling!
This shouldn't be a problem with "<ModOp>" and "<GUID>", but if "Text" should be translated into your target language, you must first replace the keyword tags with uncritical placeholders (e.g. "<Text>" => "<XYZ>") and afterwards undo this ("<XYZ>" => "<Text>"), each with a text editor command such as "replace all" and the "case sensitive" option.

If successful, the entire process should take no longer than about half an hour. If you consider that I have invested well over 100 hours in this mod so far, I would consider that a fair personal contribution.
Good luck!

(By the way: This method should work the same way for all other mods.)


## Known Issues

- The user interface of the Ministry main building corresponds to that of a cultural building and therefore does not fit perfectly with the design of an administration building, especially in terms of labeling.
- The base tiles for the default version of the personnel office (archibald's island pavilion) protrude a little too far beyond the building.
	For this reason I have implemented the option to build over or under the object; if suitable pavement graphics are used, the cosmetic defect can be elegantly concealed.
- The effect calculated for the "press spokesman" does not (yet) work 100% as intended; at least the display is not transparent.
- For the consuls, "Arctic Lodge" is displayed as the socket destination: This is intentional due to a technical trick to prevent other items from being socketed in the consulates.
- In rare cases it can happen that the game - for whatever reason - resets the visitor pool of the respective island to default despite an active "President" or "Consul".
	It usually helps to briefly remove the item from its socket and then reinsert it straight away. This should have an impact on the next visitor ship at the latest.
	For this reason, it is not recommended to temporarily override the "President" or one of his "Consuls" while they do their job as desired.

Please do not hesitate to leave any additional anomalies and problems as well as your own remarks in the comments section of mod.io.

## Personal Note

This is only the second mod I release.
I therefore ask for your continued indulgence in the event of any bumps in support, lack of experience with conventions and/or lack of language support.
It's easy to see that I lack any graphic skills. For this reason, all of my mods are limited to using the graphic objects already included in the original game (exception: icons).
If you like and have the necessary skills, you are hereby expressly permitted to integrate your own graphics into the mod (of course only for your own use).


## Special thanks and appreciation

These apply:
- the entire Anno Team for a great game and support for mods;
- the Modding Community, whose great work is always a source of inspiration for me;
- Finnem for his (formerly) great mods "The Academy" and "The Administration", which provided the basic idea for this mod.


Have fun!
